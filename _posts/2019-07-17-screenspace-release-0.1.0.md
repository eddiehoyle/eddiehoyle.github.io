Screenspace 0.1.0 has been released! [Grab the source here.](https://github.com/eddiehoyle/screenspace/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

This version comes with a fresh batch of features and a few bug fixes.

1. Added CHANGELOG.md
2. Added triangle shape
3. Fixed circle geometry being twice as big as other shapes
4. Moved geometry pivots to bottom left of all shapes
5. Added rotation

**Note:** Layouts built prior to this release may display differently due to the geometry and pivot changes. A few offset and size attribute tweaks should restore order.

Found a bug or have any questions? Feel free to pop in an issue on [Github](https://github.com/eddiehoyle/screenspace/issues).
